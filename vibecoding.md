Alright, let’s design a real (but confusing) esolang inspired by **vibe coding**. We'll call it:

---

# **VYB++**  
> _"It compiles because it feels right."_

### 📘 Language Spec

---

## 📌 Overview

VYB++ is a statically vague, semi-compiled esolang with Java/C-style syntax and a completely unhelpful standard library. It is Turing-complete, but you'll regret proving it.

The philosophy: **You probably meant something like this.**

---

## 🔤 Syntax: Familiar, But Off

### ➕ Declarations

- Variable declarations use `letish` or `couldbe`.
- Types are inferred *unless* you insist, which you shouldn't.

```vyb++
letish num = 5;          // probably an int
couldbe name = "VYB";    // probably a string
letish List maybe[3];    // maybe a list? not guaranteed
```

---

### 🔄 Functions

Functions are declared with `maybe`, and their return types are... optional.

```vyb++
maybe add(whatever x, whatever y) {
    return x + y; // may or may not return
}
```

Overloading is automatic. Conflicts are resolved by vibe score, which is based on how frequently you used that version earlier.

---

### ⌛ Control Flow

```vyb++
when (x > ~10) {      // ~ means "sort of"
    vibe "biggish number!";
} elseish {
    vibe "meh";
}
```

Keywords:
- `when` instead of `if`
- `alsoish` instead of `else`
- `perhaps` for switch/case-like fuzzy matches

```vyb++
perhaps (feeling) {
    is "happy": vibe "Yay!";
    islike "angry": vibe "Oh no";
    otherwise: vibe "huh?";
}
```

---

## 📊 Types (Kinda)

You get:
- `intish`
- `string?`
- `float...maybe`
- `bool¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
- `null` is called `poof`

All types are mutable unless declared with `lock`, which does nothing.

---

## 📦 Standard Library

- `vibe(string)` – prints something similar to the string
- `conjure()` – creates a vaguely typed object
- `estimate(value)` – returns an approximate version of `value`
- `scry(type)` – guesses the type of a variable
- `align(a, b)` – forces two values to agree on vibes

---

## 🔁 Loops

```vyb++
wander until x ~= 10 {
    x = x ~+ 1;   // ~+ is "increment, sorta"
}
```

Loops:
- `wander` (like `while`)
- `roam n times` (like `for`)
- `drift` (infinite, unless stopped)

---

## 🔧 Operators

| Operator | Meaning                      |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| `~=`     | approximately equals          |
| `~+`     | kinda adds                    |
| `==!`    | equal but with doubt          |
| `!*`     | not but enthusiastic          |
| `>>>~`   | shifts right, if that’s okay  |

---

## ⚙ Example

```vyb++
maybe main() {
    letish mood = "weird";
    when (mood ~= "normal") {
        vibe "all good";
    } alsoish {
        drift {
            vibe "looping forever-ish...";
        }
    }
}
```
