To witness harmony, one must contemplate the path.

To contemplate, one must compare the path with its own reflection.

To compare, one must ask:
    When both the path and the reflection are void,
        choose truth;
    When either fades into void,
        choose falsehood;
    When the first of the path equals the last of the reflection,
        choose the result of comparing the rest with the beginning;
    otherwise,
        choose falsehood.

To reflect, one must reverse the journey.

To reverse, one must walk from the end to the start, remembering each step.

To first of, one must listen to the path's opening.

To last of, one must listen to the path's closing.

To rest of, one must follow the path, ignoring the first.

To beginning of, one must follow the path, ignoring the last.

Allow unrest to witness harmony within the path of [1, 2, 3, 4].
